        Sorry for the large gap since ive made any updates. Ive been under high
        servalance recently because apperently my small "time edits" are very
        illegal, and the wizard-police launched an investigation into my magic
        usage.<br><br>
        I promise I'm working as diligently as i can to get the timeline reset.
        The investigation shouldnt last too much longer i dont think, so I'll get
        those leads soon!<br>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Update 2 <span class="gray"> (new! <span style="font-size:0.75em"> 11/5/25 </span>) </span> <br>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Im sorry for the extra hoops im having to have you jump through,
        but after further recerch ive realized that in theory anyone
        could-with enough determination- steal the magic of the other
        universes for themselves, and i can't have some reckless person
        running around the city playing with time as they will. <br><br>

        To avoid that, ive given those I trust a password to get them
        through to the actual site. Its not foolproof, but i think it
        should do the trick.<br>
