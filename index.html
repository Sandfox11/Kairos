        Im sorry for the extra hoops im having to have you jump through,
        but after further recerch ive realized that in theory anyone
        could-with enough determination- steal the magic of the other
        universes for themselves, and i can't have some reckless person
        running around the city playing with time as they will. <br><br>

        To avoid that, ive given those I trust a password to get them
        through to the actual site. Its not foolproof, but i think it
        should do the trick.<br>
