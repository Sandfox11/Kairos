        Sorry for the large gap since ive made any updates. Ive been under high servalance recently because my small "time edits" are apperently very illegal, and so i havent been able to progress much without proving im guilty. <br>
        I promise im working as diligently as i can to get the timeline reset. The investigation into my magic shouldnt last too much longer i dont think, so ill get those leads soon!<br>
