          Hi, I'm Finn, the resedent time-wizard of our lovely town. Recently, Alphones—who was very dear to all of us— was fately injured in a car accident, and for all of our sakes i need to rewind time and fix it. The only issue being, well... Im out of magic. I didnt know till now that my magic was finite, but apperently so. <br>
          That, is whare you come in. After a little research, i discovered that every universe has its own supply of magic, in the form of a sacred orb, and i need people who are deeply fromilier with those universes to help me find the orbs. I will keep this site updated with any leads i find.
